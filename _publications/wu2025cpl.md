excerpt: |
    Achieving long spin coherence times is crucial for quantum precision measurements, and closed-
    loop control techniques are often employed to accomplish this goal. Here, we demonstrate the
    impact of closed-loop feedback control on nuclear spin precession in a MEOP-based polarized \\(^3\\)He
    system. We analyze the effects of feedback theoretically and validate our predictions experimen-
    tally. With optimized feedback parameters, the spin coherence time \\(T_2\\) is extended by an order of
    magnitude. When the feedback strength surpasses a critical threshold, robust maser oscillations are
    spontaneously excited, demonstrating remarkable resistance to environmental noise and maintaining
    stable oscillation. This proof-of-principle experiment highlights the viability of MEOP-based \\(^3\\)He
    spin oscillators, especially in low-frequency domains. The operational simplicity and easy integra-
    tion associated with MEOP-based systems make them particularly promising for fast, high-precision
    magnetic field measurements.
