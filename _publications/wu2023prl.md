excerpt: |
    Exotic spin-dependent interactions involving new light particles address key questions in modern physics. Interactions between polarized neutrons (n) and unpolarized nucleons (N) occur in three forms: \\(g_S^Ng^n_P\vec{\sigma}\cdot\vec{r}\\), \\(g_V^Ng^n_A\vec{\sigma}\cdot\vec{v}\\), and \\(g_A^Ng^n_A\vec{\sigma}\cdot(\vec{v}\times\vec{r}\\), where \\(\vec\sigma\\) is the spin and gâ€™s are the corresponding coupling constants for scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial-vector vertexes. If such interactions exist, the Sun and Moon could induce sidereal variations of effective fields in laboratories. By analyzing existing data from laboratory measurements on Lorentz and CPT violation, we derive new experimental upper limits on these exotic spin-dependent interactions at astronomical ranges. Our limits on gSNgnP surpass the previous combined astrophysical-laboratory limits, setting the most stringent experimental constraints to date. We also report new constraints on vector-axial-vector and axial-axial-vector interactions at astronomical scales, with vector-axial-vector limits improved by \\(\sim 12\\) orders of magnitude. We extend our analysis to Hari Dass interactions and obtain new constraints.
