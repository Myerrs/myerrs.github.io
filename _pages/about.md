About 
======

Hi there! Welcome to my corner of the web. I'm Liangyong Wu, a Ph.D. candidate diving deep into Particle and Nuclear Physics at Fudan University in Shanghai, China.

On this site, you’ll find my research interests, the latest updates on my publications, and snapshots of my recent academic activities. But it’s not all physics here—I also love sharing fun, unforgettable moments from my life, whether in pictures or stories.

Feel free to explore and join me on this journey through science and life!
